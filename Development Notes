-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.


1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd saveetha-hostel-app
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```


1.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This will start the application and open it in your default browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.


-   **Mock Data:** Currently, much of the data (students, rooms, authentication) is mocked for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this data would be fetched from and sent to a backend API.
-   **Authentication:** The `AuthContext` and `useAuth` hook manage user authentication state. Local storage is used for persistence.
-   **Routing:** `react-router-dom` is used for navigation. Protected routes ensure that only authorized users can access certain pages.
-   **Font Awesome:** Icons are used for dashboard elements. Ensure you have Font Awesome loaded in your project (e.g., via CDN in `public/index.html` or installed as a dependency). I've added `font-awesome` to devDependencies, but you might need to include its CSS.
